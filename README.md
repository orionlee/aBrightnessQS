# Brightness toggle Quick Settings 
- requires Nougat (Android 7)
- add a brightness toggle tile to quick settings
- useful when the quick settings is in compact mode (without the brightness sliders)

## TODOS
- toggle through brightness steps: 
  - use predefined / hardcoded steps
  - UI to configure the steps
- UI to request WRITE_SETTINGS permission
- drawing percentage over the tile icon?
- Use SVG for launch icon
- Refactor some codes with closures, which requires using java 8Java 8 (jack toolchain)

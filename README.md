# Brightness toggle Quick Settings 
- requires Nougat (Android 7)
- add a brightness toggle tile to quick settings
- useful when the quick settings is in compact mode (without the brightness sliders)

## TODOS
- toggle through brightness steps: 
  - [x] use predefined / hardcoded steps
  - UI to configure the steps
- [x] Get a relase build (requires a certificate)
- UI to request WRITE_SETTINGS permission
- drawing percentage over the tile icon?
- Refactor some codes with closures, which requires using Java 8 (jack toolchain)
- (Not possible) NoUse SVG for launch icon
